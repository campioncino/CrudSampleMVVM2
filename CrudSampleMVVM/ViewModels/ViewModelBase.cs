/*
 * In our application though, we're going to create a base class 
 * for our ViewModels called ViewModelBase, which will inherit from 
 * the Screen class, but will also contain an instance of the 
 * INavigationService (injected), as well as a property indicating 
 * whether we can navigate backwards, and a method that performs 
 * the navigation. 

 * With this base class in place, any of our ViewModels that derive
 * from it, will have access to the INavigationService and as such, 
 * they'll be able to navigate to another View or ViewModel. 
 * The GoBack() method will also be bound by convention to the back 
 * button, and will only be displayed when we can actually go back.
